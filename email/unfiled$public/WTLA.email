Hello, 

Thanks for coming by the booth last week in Los Angeles. Hope you remember Copado is an end-to-end release management solution that helps organizations launch error-free deployments and updates via a full suite of DevOps tools within Salesforce.

If you didnâ€™t have the chance to see our product, here's that link to our Session at Dreamforce.

Is there a good time to catch up with you this week?
