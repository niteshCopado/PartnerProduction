Dear,

We recently had a webinar on our Compliance Hub and wanted to share the link for your review: Copado Compliance Hub Webinar.

We didn't get a chance to cover this in the demo, but many of our customer's are looking to eventually tackling this requirement, especially for highly regulated companies.  An example of this is a deployment that occurred with errors.  The Copado's Compliance Hub would allow you to implement safety mechanisms that conform to your business requirements. 

How's the evaluation process going?  Hope to hear from you soon.
