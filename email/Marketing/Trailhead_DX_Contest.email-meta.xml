    <textOnly>Copado is pleased to invite you to TraildheaDX on June 28 and 29, where we will be participating as Expedition Sponsor.

Among all the new reviews we receive for our AppExchange App (since June 12), the first 10 AppExchange reviews will receive a 10% discount code for the purchase of your tickets.

We will also offer a completely free pass so that you can attend the event with the Copado Team, which will be chosen by Copado among all the participants.

On the 21st we will announce the winners on LinkedIn.

You can invite your contacts to participate by using the hashtag #CopadoTrailheaDX17 on twitter.
