    <textOnly>Dear valued user:

We are pleased to inform you that after the new patch Copado v7.1.6 we launched on 2017-04-27, it brings a new improvement where CCM only users are now able to Sync Environments within the Branch Management app, as long as they have been granted permissions at the Environment level.

We hope this new improvement will help you in your release management process.
