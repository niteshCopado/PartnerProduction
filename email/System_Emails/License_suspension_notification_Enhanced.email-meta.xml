    <textOnly>Dear Copado User,

Due to licensing constraints we require a corporate email address. Please could you send us an email from your corporate address for your license to be activated.

We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience. Once the corporate email has been verified your application will be enabled.

Many thanks in advance.
